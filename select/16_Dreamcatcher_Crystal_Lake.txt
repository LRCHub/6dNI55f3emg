This spark of light
When it blinds you see 'em?
To rewind those nights
My heart kept racing
Out of sight, out of mind
'Cause every moment dream became a precious sign
The truth is I was far away from home
Day and night exposed and enclosed as I felt alone
But boom
Camera and action,
Flare of light turns the night from a dream to reality
When everything I've schemed of and
What I've believed got this spotlight on me

Now this dawn's upon me
This flare of light
I believe I see 'em
When I scream out loud
I forget I'm speaking
From this memory lane
I can start again
Just to reflect upon this reason it began
I know even if I got this burning fire inside
There's a mother that gave birth to two and kept them alive
One kept breathing and believed in something others despised
Well I breathe and believe what sis has always inspired

You were the spark of light
So let's burn up the sky

To the stars with all I've got
Now it's time to call the shots
To the stars, to the stars
To the stars with everything I've got
We've come this far
To the stars with all I've got
Now it's time to call the shots
To the stars, to the stars
To the stars with everything I've got
We've come this far
We break every boundary in sight

Burn it up, give it all you've got
Burn it up, give it all you've got
Fuel the fire
Burn it up, give it all you've got
Fuel the fire

Light up the sky
Our dreams shall ignite
You were the spark of light
So let's burn up the night

To the stars with all I've got
Now it's time to call the shots
To the stars, to the stars
To the stars with everything I've got
We've come this far
To the stars with all I've got
Now it's time to call the shots
To the stars, to the stars
To the stars with everything I've got
We've come this far
We break every boundary in sight

Come take me far from here
It's dark and deep

I can dream alive
I can feel alive
I can dream alive
I can feel alive

In my youth, I was dreaming
And I still keep dreaming
Of what I wanna do and what I wanna be
Like a vulture, I'm seeking
Won't regret what I've done
'Cause in the end, there's no turning back
I'll pursuit the life to reach beyond
Reach beyond the sun

I feel alive
I feel alive, tonight is the night
I feel alive
I feel alive, tonight is the night that I'm alive
