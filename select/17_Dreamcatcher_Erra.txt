Nurtured by the spirits of the wilderness
The only mother we have left
She is the web in the willow hoop like feathers
We just hang in the air
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
While nightmares wear
Wear down the dancing lines of her woven web
Hanging beneath the nightmare
We fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you
We fall apart, we fall apart
Restore youth
Ghost of the willow trees
The oak, the pines, the bowing mountain peaks
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
Open arms to a mother's gift
Electric sensations pulsating through our ribs
Breathing life into our dreams
The weight of man is crushing me
The weight of man is crushing me
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through ocean seas
Oh, mother,
I am breaking down
Oh, mother,
I call to you
Ghost of the willows,
The weight of man is crushing me
I am falling apart broken into someone less than who I'm meant to be
I am lost,
I am lost
Bring forth the solace of your breeze
From looming pines through ocean seas
Bring life into	thee stagnant feet
Restore the man that I'm meant to be
Hanging beneath the nightmare
We fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you
We fall apart, we fall apart
Restore youth
Hanging beneath the nightmare
We fall apart
Hoping you'll call our names
Sweet voice we'll follow
In trying to preserve you
We fall apart, we fall apart
Restore youth
